User access tokens are generally obtained via a login dialog
and require a person to permit your app to obtain one.
This kind of access token is needed to modify and read app settings.

If you're talking about the token identifying you as you and allowing you access to parts of whatever it is you're
logging into, yes they are generated when you login.

The website takes whatever credentials you entered, and compares them to the saved information in the database. If you
login successfully, the website will send you a randomly generated (but cryptographically secure) token. This is saved
in your browser, so that whenever you request access to a part of the site, your browser can show the token to identify
itself as being logged on legitimately.

If the site or the siteâ€™s authorization service is Oauth2.0 compliant, access tokens are generated as part of the
authentication (login) process. Those tokens are valid for a configurable period of time and then must be
regenerated/refreshed.

Acces tokens can be persisted by client applications via cookie or some other caching mechanism and attached to HTTP
requests against resources (URLs) that require authorization to acess.
